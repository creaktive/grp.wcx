OK, that's simple. Just check if your compiler is TASM 5.0 and then execute DO.BAT.
It should create GRP.WCX file. You can also compile it in debug mode:

make /DDEBUG

But it's probably non-sense as WCX is just a renamed DLL and it runs *from inside*
Windows Commander... So, for debugging purposes I created a special EXE tester stub.
Edit "exe_stub.asm" to fit your needs and then try out:

make /DDEBUG grp.exe
td32 grp

Now that's OK to debug ;)
And well, if you say me you can code WCX plugin with *NO* debugging at all,
I GONNA KICK YOUR ASS!!!

Good luck, man!
